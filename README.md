# 👋 Hey there, welcome to my GitHub!

Thanks for dropping by — I’m really glad you’re here!

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I’m **Mohamed ishauq**, an Electronics and Communication Engineering student who loves building cool projects with microcontrollers and embedded systems.  
Here's what I currently do and know:

- 🔧 Comfortable with **C Language** and **C++**
- 📖 Learning **Bare-Metal Programming** using STM32 boards  
- 🛠️ Can read and understand **MCU Datasheets** and **Reference Manuals**
- 💻 Using **STM32CubeIDE** for programming
- 🤖 I work with **ESP32**, **Arduino**, and other electronics whenever I can

## 🚀 My Projects

Here are a few things I'm working on or have built:

- 🤖 **DRIVERS** development in *bare metal programming* using *stm32cubeIDE*
- 🤖 **RC car** – Built with Arduino, ultrasonic sensors, and L293D motor driver which can be controlled via voice,remote(app) or can act like obstacle avoidance car too!
- 🤖 **GPS-Guided Autonomous Car** – Navigates to coordinates sent via Bluetooth using ESP32, GPS, IMU, encoder, and obstacle detection(on going will finish it soon!)
- 🤖 **Medical Delivery Drone (ESP32-based)** – A budget drone for emergency supply delivery(on bending cause of im a student with limited budget)


*(I'll keep updating this list as I build more!)*
